\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The project aims to build a simple protocol that supports data collection and allows the sink to send packets to specific nodes of the wireless network.
Despite its simplicity, the protocol can be easily extended to cover other scenarios. For example, thanks to the \texttt{is\_command} flag contained in header of every packet, any node (and not only the sink) could have the chance to send unicast packets.
